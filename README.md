# Jenkins on EC2 with S3 Backup

## Overview

This project provides a **cost-effective, on-demand Jenkins server** solution for DevOps teams. By leveraging AWS EC2 and S3, you can spin up a Jenkins server with the latest configuration and job data, run your CI/CD workloads, and then destroy all resources except your S3 backup. This approach minimizes AWS costs by only running Jenkins when you need it, while always preserving your Jenkins state and configuration in S3.

---

## Purpose

- **Save DevOps money:** Only pay for Jenkins EC2 resources when you need them.
- **On-demand Jenkins:** Quickly provision a Jenkins server with the latest jobs, plugins, and configuration.
- **Persistent backups:** All Jenkins data is backed up to S3, so you can destroy and recreate your Jenkins server at any time.
- **Automated restore:** On launch, the server automatically restores from the latest S3 backup if available.
- **Automated backup:** Jenkins data is backed up to S3 daily and after 30 minutes of initial setup.

---


---

## Features

- Automated Jenkins installation and configuration on Amazon Linux 2 EC2.
- Automated restore of Jenkins home from S3 if a backup exists.
- Automated update of Jenkins public URL after restore.
- Automated daily and initial (30 min after boot) backup to S3.
- Easy manual backup trigger.
- Safe to destroy all AWS resources except the S3 bucketâ€”restore will always bring back your latest Jenkins state.

## Usage Instructions

### 1. **Clone the Repository**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-org/jenkins-on-ec2-s3-backup.git
cd jenkins-on-ec2-s3-backup
```

### 2. **Configure Your Variables**

Create a `terraform.tfvars` file in the project root with your settings:

```hcl
region         = "us-east-1"                         # AWS region (e.g., N. Virginia)
s3_bucket_name = "jenkins-backup-bucket-20240505"    # Globally unique S3 bucket name
my_ip          = "203.0.113.42/32"                   # Your IP address for SSH/Jenkins access
instance_type  = "t2.medium                    # EC2 instance type for Jenkins
```

### 3. **Initialize and Apply Terraform**

```sh
terraform init
terraform apply
```

- This will provision all AWS resources and start Jenkins.
- The Jenkins server will be accessible at `http://<public-ip>:8080`.

## How to Get the Initial Jenkins Admin Password

- **On a fresh install (no backup):**
  1. SSH into your EC2 instance:
     ```sh
     ssh -i ./jenkins-key.pem ec2-user@<public-ip>
     ```
  2. View the password in the user data log:
     ```sh
     sudo grep "Initial admin password" -A 1 /var/log/user-data.log
     ```
     or directly from the container:
     ```sh
     sudo docker exec jenkins cat /var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword
     ```

- **On restore from backup:**  
  If you restored a Jenkins home with setup completed, log in with your existing admin credentials. The initial password file may not exist.

---

## How to Run a Manual Backup

To trigger a manual backup of Jenkins data to S3 at any time:

1. **SSH into your EC2 instance:**
   ```sh
   ssh -i ./jenkins-key.pem ec2-user@<public-ip>
   ```

2. **Run the backup script:**
   ```sh
   sudo /usr/local/bin/jenkins_backup.sh
   ```

- This will sync the entire Jenkins home directory to your S3 bucket.
- The backup includes all jobs, plugins, configurations, and build history.
- You should see progress output as files are uploaded to S3.

---

## Cost-Saving Workflow

1. **Run Jenkins when needed:**  
   Use `terraform apply` to provision Jenkins with the latest backup.
2. **Destroy resources when not needed:**  
   Use `terraform destroy` (after removing the S3 bucket from state with `terraform state rm aws_s3_bucket.jenkins_backup`) to delete all AWS resources except your S3 backup.
3. **Restore anytime:**  
   Use `terraform apply` again to bring Jenkins back with all jobs, plugins, and configuration restored from S3.

## Example `terraform.tfvars`

```hcl
region         = "ap-southeast-1"                         # AWS region (e.g., Singapore)
s3_bucket_name = "jenkins-backup-bucket-unique-20240505"  # Globally unique S3 bucket name
my_ip          = "198.51.100.77/32"                       # Your IP address for SSH/Jenkins access
instance_type  = "t3.large"                               # EC2 instance type for Jenkins
```

---

## Local Development & Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/jenkins-on-ec2-s3-backup.git
   cd jenkins-on-ec2-s3-backup
   ```

2. **Install prerequisites:**
   - [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)
   - [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
   - AWS credentials configured (`aws configure`)

3. **Edit `terraform.tfvars` with your settings.**

4. **Initialize and apply:**
   ```sh
   terraform init
   terraform apply
   ```

5. **Access Jenkins:**
   - Find the public IP in Terraform outputs or AWS Console.
   - Open `http://<public-ip>:8080` in your browser.

## Destroying and Restoring Jenkins

- To **destroy all resources except your S3 backup**:
  ```sh
  terraform state rm aws_s3_bucket.jenkins_backup
  terraform destroy
  ```
- To **restore Jenkins**:
  ```sh
  terraform apply
  ```
  Jenkins will be restored from the latest S3 backup.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Check logs:**  
  SSH into your instance and view `/var/log/user-data.log` for provisioning output and errors.
- **Check Jenkins container:**  
  ```sh
  sudo docker ps -a
  sudo docker logs jenkins
  ```
- **Check backup script:**  
  ```sh
  sudo cat /usr/local/bin/jenkins_backup.sh
  ```
